# PHP Project using Vagrant

### Folder and Files structure

- `Vagrantfile` - contains all required stuff to run the virtualised environment for development. It is intended to colaborate nicely with __PHPStorm__
- `scripts/` contains file required by Vagrant or some CLI related stuff
- `.vagrant/` is created when you initialize Vagrant. __Do not mess with it!__
